This lab is intended to give some practice with the skip list data type. Weâ€™ll use the skip list as a database indexing strategy that lets us make useful queries quickly. The specific application will be an interface to a good-sized database of historical events collected from several sources around the Web.

The basic skip list type can be made more space-efficient in two ways. I implement both of the following optimizations:

* Dynamically resize the head and tail pillars. 
* Singly-linked skip list
