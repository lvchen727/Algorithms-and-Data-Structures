#####In this project, I implemented the two closest-pair algorithms: the naive algorithm and the divide-and-conquer algorithm in C++. 

The algorithms found the closest pair of points in the input and printed their coordinates, along with the distance between them. In the report, I compared the performance of the naive and divide-and-conquer closest pair algorithms in terms of the running time and input size. Also, I estimated the “crossover” input size where the divide-and-conquer method first started to consistently outperform the naive algorithm.
